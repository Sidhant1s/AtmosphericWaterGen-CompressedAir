# AtmosphericWaterGen-CompressedAir

**Conceptual Project by Sidhant Negi**

## 🌍 Overview

This project outlines a **conceptual design** for atmospheric water generation (AWG) using **compressed air storage and condensation**, targeted especially for **low-humidity or arid environments** where traditional AWG methods fail.

By decoupling the air collection and moisture condensation phases, this system enables water extraction from stored air, functioning even in desert conditions. It is scalable, modular, and adaptable for use in defense, humanitarian, and off-grid applications.

## ⚙️ System Components

- **Air Intake Module**: Pulls ambient air into the system using high-speed fans.
- **Compression Unit**: Stores large volumes of air under pressure.
- **Cooling Chamber**: Releases and condenses the air to extract water.
- **Filtration & Storage**: Filters and stores clean drinking water.

## 💡 Features

- Works in **low-humidity zones**
- Stores air like a **"moisture battery"**
- Runs on **renewable energy (solar-compatible)**
- **Scalable** for rural or industrial use
- Potential for **AI-based optimization** in future development

## 🤝 Collaboration

This project is **open for collaboration** with:
- Research institutions
- Defense R&D teams
- NGOs working in water-scarce regions
- Environmental technology startups
